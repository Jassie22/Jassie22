# Jasmeen Dahak

## Full-Stack Developer | Automation & AI Data Specialist

I build automation-heavy, API-driven systems and work on large-scale AI data training and evaluation projects. My experience spans full-stack development, backend systems, workflow automation, and technical evaluation of large language models, with a strong foundation in Python and data analysis.

Alongside freelance and contract work, I run **True Node**, where I design and deliver production systems for clients, covering everything from database architecture and APIs to real-time frontends and automated workflows.
